# Security Guidelines for Beacon AI

## Handling Secrets

This repository has been updated to prevent secrets from being exposed publicly. Here's what has been done and what still needs to be done:

### Completed Steps
1. Added `.gitignore` files to prevent `.env` files from being committed
2. Removed `.env` files from Git tracking
3. Created `.env.example` template file with placeholders instead of actual secrets

### Required Actions
To complete securing your application, please take the following steps:

1. **Rotate all compromised credentials immediately:**
   - MongoDB password in connection string
   - Clerk API keys
   - ImageKit API keys
   - SambaNova API key

2. **Never commit `.env` files or files containing secrets again**
   - Always use `.env.example` as a template
   - Each developer should create their own local `.env` file

3. **For deployment platforms:**
   - Use environment variable configuration in your deployment platforms
   - Consider these options:
     - Vercel: Environment Variables section in the project settings
     - Netlify: Environment Variables in Build & Deploy settings
     - Heroku: Config Vars in the Settings tab
     - Docker: Use Docker secrets or environment variables in docker-compose

4. **Consider using a dedicated secrets manager for production:**
   - [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
   - [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)
   - [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

## Best Practices
- Never hardcode secrets in your application code
- Rotate secrets regularly, especially after team member changes
- Use different secrets for development, staging, and production environments
- Limit access to production secrets to essential personnel only
